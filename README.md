Hello there!

Here you can find my latest drafts for my Master's thesis at KTH in Computer Science. The working title of the project is "An Unsupervised Exploration of the CNN Feature Space for Phenotype Structure Discovery in Alzheimer’s Disease". The script/notebook for conducting the experiments can be found here as well as the thesis paper, but because of GDPR and ethical rules no data or prior workings of the data will be added here. Feel free to look through it or send me message for any questions regarding the project.

Have a lovely day! :)

// Sofia
