Hello!

This is my latest drafts for my Master's thesis at KTH within Computer Science.
The working title of the project is "An Unsupervised Exploration of the CNN Feature Space for Phenotype Structure Discovery in Alzheimer’s Disease".
The script for conducting the expiriments can be found here as well as the thesis paper, but because of GDPR and ethical rules, no data or prior workings of the data will be added here.
Feel free to look through it or send me message for any questions regarding the project.

Have a lovely day! :)
